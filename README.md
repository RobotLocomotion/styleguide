Drake Style Guide
=================

This repository is a fork of Google's style guide.  Drake's C++ style is a
small deviation from Google's, and approximately tracks Google's latest style
guidance at a small delay.

The README for Google's style guide follows after some Drake-specific notes
below.

Maintenance Philosophy
----------------------

This style guide should be updated in two cases:

 * The agreement of the Drake platform reviewers on a change to our style
   rules.

 * A change from the upstream Google style guide which has been reviewed (and
   altered if necessary) by the Drake platform reviewers.

Both sorts of updates should use ordinary Reviewable review for the platform
reviewer discussion.

When making a change, annotate an html tag surrounding the new material with
`class="drake"`.  This makes it easy for readers to see Drake-relevant
changes and for maintainers to understand our diffs.  Annotate Google material
that is superseded by Drake changes but is still useful for reference with
`class="nondrake"`.

When making a change, avoid changing whitespace or indentation unnecessarily.
Conflict resolution is difficult in prose text, and conflicts that are just
paragraph reflows make future maintainers cry.

Making New Changes
------------------

Branch, update, and PR as you would any other Drake change.

Pulling Upstream Changes
------------------------

A Drake style guide maintainer should keep a local clone of this repository.
This should be set up in the usual manner, but with remotes to both Google and
Drake as you will want to be able to rebase from either one:

 * Fork "styleguide" into your account, this is where all your branches will be

   * Go to https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/styleguide and press "Fork" in
     the top-right corner.  If prompted for the account to fork to, select
     your account.

 * Check out your own fork

   * Go to forked repository https://github.com/**USERNAME**/styleguide and
     press the green "Clone or download" button, then select "ssh" and copy
     ssh URL

   * Clone it on your local machine:

            git clone URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED
            cd styleguide

 * Add a "drake" remote for the Drake styleguide and make it the default
   upstream.  Note that for compatibility with Google, we use the branch
   `gh-pages` as our master:

        git remote add drake git@github.com:RobotLocomotion/styleguide.git
        git remote set-url --push drake no_push
        git branch --set-upstream-to drake/gh-pages

 * Add a "google" remote for the Drake styleguide:

        git remote add google git@github.com:google/styleguide.git
        git remote set-url --push google no_push

Now that you have a repository and remotes set up, you want to be up-to-date
with Drake and then pull Google's changes:

    git co gh-pages
    git pull --ff-only
    git co -b **NEW_BRANCH_NAME**
    git pull --rebase google gh-pages
    **RESOLVE CONFLICTS**
    git push --set-upstream origin **NEW_BRANCH_NAME**
    **ORDINARY PR PROCESS**

There is a high likelihood that this rebase will have conflicts.  These
conflicts represent google changes to or near Drake-specific style rules and
should be considered carefully rather than accepted or rejected blindly.

When you have resolved the rebase you should commit, push, and PR in the usual
manner.  In creating the PR, double-check that you are PR'ing against
`RobotLocomotion/styleguide`, not `google/styleguide`.

You should add [all of the platform reviewers](http://drake.mit.edu/developers.html#review-process) to the resulting PR.

Google Style Guides
===================

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for Google code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Google, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.

This project holds the [C++ Style Guide][cpp], [Objective-C Style Guide][objc],
[Java Style Guide][java], [Python Style Guide][py], [R Style Guide][r],
[Shell Style Guide][sh], [HTML/CSS Style Guide][htmlcss],
[JavaScript Style Guide][js], [AngularJS Style Guide][angular],
[Common Lisp Style Guide][cl], and [Vimscript Style Guide][vim]. This project
also contains [cpplint][cpplint], a tool to assist with style guide compliance,
and [google-c-style.el][emacs], an Emacs settings file for Google style.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the [XML
Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual style
rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.
